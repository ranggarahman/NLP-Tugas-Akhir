# **NLP Tweet Classifier for 2022 FIFA World Cup**  

Welcome to the **2022 FIFA World Cup Tweet Classifier Project**! This project is an exploration into Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of Tweets about the 2022 World Cup. Using machine learning, we trained and utilized a sentiment analysis model to understand public opinion on the event.

## **Overview**  

The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was a global spectacle, generating significant online discussions. This project focuses on:  
1. Retrieving Tweets about the event using the X/Twitter API.  
2. Training an NLP-based classifier model to categorize sentiment (**Positive**, **Negative**).  
3. Drawing insights about public opinion during the event.  

### **Key Findings**  
- The majority of tweets showed **positive sentiment**, reflecting excitement and support for the tournament.  
- However, a subset of tweets revealed **negative sentiments**, particularly around controversial topics such as **labor rights** and **logistics**.  
- Neutral tweets often contained factual updates or general observations about the event.
